**Functional test requires version 20.01.01 or higher of the Topaz Workbench CLI.**

**Functional Test tests that contain 'SQL Select' or 'SQL Update' palette elements require DB2 jar files on the classpath for using JDBC to access DB2 on the mainframe, and these jar files must be available. By default the Functional Test CLI looks for these jarfiles in <install directory>/dbDrivers.The user must create the directory and copy the user specific DB2 jar files to this directory. Typically there are two jar files, one with the DB2 driver and one with the DB2 license. They are typically named db2jcc.jar and db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar.**
